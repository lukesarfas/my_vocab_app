# my_vocab_app

This is my attempt of getting back into mobile development using Flutter.

Having a lot of fun, just trying to learn the correct code conventions at the moment.


## Project goals

I wanted to have a space to store all the new vocab I am learning, and currently am storing it all in Safari tabs on my phone.
